## Cosmic Contemplation

When I'm not pushing code or attending meetups, you'll often find me lost in the realms of:

-   🌌 Science fiction, where time travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life spark my imagination.
-   🧙‍♂️ Ancient myths, unsolved mysteries, and the enigmatic weave of spirituality that weaves through human history.

## 🌟 Let's Connect
